# Smart-Traffic-Management-System 🚗💨
An interactive web application that finds the fastest route in a simulated city using Dijkstra's algorithm. This project features a dynamic map with 7+ intersections and 11+ road segments, rendered in real-time with the Canvas API. 


✨ Key Features
⚡️ Blazing Fast Route Calculation: Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the most efficient path with calculation times consistently under 50ms.

🗺️ Interactive City Map: Features a custom-built map with 7+ intersections and 11 road segments, allowing users to select start and end points dynamically.

🎨 Real-Time Visualization: Utilizes the Canvas API to visually render the intersections, roads, and the calculated fastest route in real-time.

📱 Fully Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface provides a clean, intuitive, and seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Visualization: Canvas API

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Core Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm

🚀 How It Works
Launch the application to see the simulated city map.

Select your starting intersection by clicking on a node.

Choose your destination by clicking on another node.

Instantly, the application calculates and draws the fastest route between the two points, highlighting the path on the canvas.

This project showcases a powerful combination of graph theory and front-end technologies to solve a real-world problem in traffic management.
